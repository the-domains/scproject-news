Keywords: Groundwater recharge Recharge mechanisms Climate change Western United States 

s u m m a r y 

Existing studies on the impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge are either global or basin/ location-specific. The global studies lack the specificity to inform decision making, while the local studies do little to clarify potential changes over large regions (major river basins, states, or groups of states), a scale often important in the development of water policy. An analysis of the potential impact of climate change on groundwater recharge across the western United States (west of 100� longitude) is presented synthesizing existing studies and applying current knowledge of recharge processes and amounts. Eight representative aquifers located across the region were evaluated. For each aquifer published recharge budget components were converted into four standard recharge mechanisms: diffuse, focused, irrigation, and mountain-systems recharge. Future changes in individual recharge mechanisms and total recharge were then estimated for each aquifer. Model-based studies of projected climate-change effects on recharge were available and utilized for half of the aquifers. For the remainder, forecasted changes in temperature and precipitation were logically propagated through each recharge mechanism producing qualitative estimates of direction of changes in recharge only (not magnitude). Several key patterns emerge from the analysis. First, the available estimates indicate average declines of 10--20% in total recharge across the southern aquifers, but with a wide range of uncertainty that includes no change.

Next, we predicted the direction of change for each recharge mechanism and for total recharge in each aquifer using either compiled prior model-based estimates (available for four of the eight aquifers) or careful consideration of how changes in temperature and precipitation will likely impact and propagate through specific processes controlling each mechanism.
